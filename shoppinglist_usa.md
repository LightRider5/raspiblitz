# Shopping List: USA

*__NOTICE: This shopping list still needs testing of listed components__ - [please report](https://github.com/rootzoll/raspiblitz/issues/691) if you have bad experiences or ideas for better cheaper updates.*

The new shopping list comes in three different packages: Minimal, Standard & Maximal:

## Package: Standard (around 250 USD)

*The "Standard Package" is most tested and recommended if you can effort it. It aims to give you the best economic value to run all the RaspiBlitz features at a good performance and even allows you to self-validate your blockchain in under 3 days.* 

* RaspBerry Pi 4 2GB + Power: [amazon.com](https://amzn.to/3be7OIg)
* ShimFan Cooling: [amazon.com](https://amzn.to/36XJNSs)
* 500GB SSD: [amazon.com](https://amzn.to/2Owv4r7)
* SSD-Case: [amazon.com](https://amzn.to/39bvDP3) or [amazon.com](https://amzn.to/2v5WGwy)
* Micro SD-Card 32GB: [amazon.com](https://amzn.to/2GZFuf2)
* LCD-Display: [amazon.com](https://amzn.to/2vbZ1WY) or [amazon.com](https://amzn.to/2Uuasnb) or [sparkfun.com](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14776)
* RaspberryPi-Case: [thecryptocloak.com](https://thecryptocloak.com/product/lightningshell/) (SELECT Rpi4!)

## Package: Minimal (around 180 USD)

*The minimal package aims for the cheapest price and allows you to use old hardware. It will always be possible to run all the basic features of a Bitcoin- & Lightning-Fullnode, but the system might be too slow to validate the blockchain history by itself and run some resource intensive extended services.*

Basic Parts for all minimal variants:
* 1TB Hard Drive: [amazon.com](https://amzn.to/39drhqN)
* Micro SD-Card 16GB: [amazon.com](https://amzn.to/36ZomQV)
* LCD-Display: [amazon.com](https://amzn.to/2v7u2uX) or [amazon.com](https://amzn.to/2uqa4LT) or [sparkfun.com](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14776)

If you have already a used RaspberryPi 3 B+ you can reuse with the following parts:
* RaspBerry Pi 3: [amazon.com](https://amzn.to/2UtWou8)
* Power >=3A: [amazon.com](https://amzn.to/2SkArLn)
* Heatsink-Case: [amazon.com](https://amzn.to/31su2BZ)

Or if you order new go with the RaspberryPi 4 2GB and the following parts:
* RaspBerry Pi 4 2GB + Power: [amazon.com](https://amzn.to/36ZoFex)
* ShimFan Cooling: [amazon.com](https://amzn.to/2H1eSKk)
* RaspberryPi-Case: (waiting for a cheap RP4 case from thecryptocloak.com - you can run without for now)

## Package: Maximal

*The maximal package is still in the works ... if you want to prepare for it, take the standard package as a base and choose the RaspberryPi4 with 4GB and a high quality 1TB SSD instead of 500GB.*

*1000GB SSD: [amazon.com](https://amzn.to/371rXOC)
